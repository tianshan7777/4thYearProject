An extravagant luxury apartment (a real playboy residence) is for rent at the best part of Kiraly street, in the middle of the downtown. You can see icons of pop culture on the design walls of the recently renovated flat.   

Two of the three rooms are separate. It has a living room + 2 bedrooms.   

There is an American style kitchen, but it is separated from the three rooms. There is black and white, chess board pattern floor. Appearances are deceptive, but in this flat all that look metal are of metal and all that look wooden is wooden.   

It is double comfort: the bigger bathroom has shower (even for six person), the smaller one has tub. There is also a big wardrobe in the bedroom.   

There is modern floor heating, the cheapest technology, this is why the cost of the heating is very low.   

The Kiraly street is one of the liveliest and most colourful streets of Budapest with pubs, clubs and interesting shops, pleasure atmosphere and the Gozsdu garden where there are new bars and a fitness room as well. In this area each side street hides a surprise. The real city lovers must definitely choose this flat.   

The public transport is excellent: at the end of the street you can find Deak square, with the three metro lines and the several night and weekend buses. In Kiraly street there is the stop of the trolleys 70 and 78.   

It is available with two months deposit and the first month rental fee for at least six months immediately.

An extravagant luxury apartment (a real playboy residence) is for rent at the best part of Kiraly street, in the middle of the downtown. You can see icons of pop culture on the design walls of the recently renovated flat.   

Two of the three rooms are separate. It has a living room + 2 bedrooms.   

There is an American style kitchen, but it is separated from the three rooms. There is black and white, chess board pattern floor. Appearances are deceptive, but in this flat all that look metal are of metal and all that look wooden is wooden.   

It is double comfort: the bigger bathroom has shower (even for six person), the smaller one has tub. There is also a big wardrobe in the bedroom.   

There is modern floor heating, the cheapest technology, this is why the cost of the heating is very low.   

The Kiraly street is one of the liveliest and most colourful streets of Budapest with pubs, clubs and interesting shops, pleasure atmosphere and the Gozsdu garden where there are new bars and a fitness room as well. In this area each side street hides a surprise. The real city lovers must definitely choose this flat.   

The public transport is excellent: at the end of the street you can find Deak square, with the three metro lines and the several night and weekend buses. In Kiraly street there is the stop of the trolleys 70 and 78.   

It is available with two months deposit and the first month rental fee for at least six months immediately.

An extravagant luxury apartment (a real playboy residence) is for rent at the best part of Kiraly street, in the middle of the downtown. You can see icons of pop culture on the design walls of the recently renovated flat.   

Two of the three rooms are separate. It has a living room + 2 bedrooms.   

There is an American style kitchen, but it is separated from the three rooms. There is black and white, chess board pattern floor. Appearances are deceptive, but in this flat all that look metal are of metal and all that look wooden is wooden.   

It is double comfort: the bigger bathroom has shower (even for six person), the smaller one has tub. There is also a big wardrobe in the bedroom.   

There is modern floor heating, the cheapest technology, this is why the cost of the heating is very low.   

The Kiraly street is one of the liveliest and most colourful streets of Budapest with pubs, clubs and interesting shops, pleasure atmosphere and the Gozsdu garden where there are new bars and a fitness room as well. In this area each side street hides a surprise. The real city lovers must definitely choose this flat.   

The public transport is excellent: at the end of the street you can find Deak square, with the three metro lines and the several night and weekend buses. In Kiraly street there is the stop of the trolleys 70 and 78.   

It is available with two months deposit and the first month rental fee for at least six months immediately.
